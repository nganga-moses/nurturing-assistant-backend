## ‚ùì Answers to Your Questions

### **Q1: Data for Inference - Does the model need new data?**

**Answer**: The model uses **vector similarity** for inference, so it works differently than traditional ML models:

1. **Training Data**: Model learns embeddings from student and engagement data
2. **Inference**: Uses stored vector representations (embeddings) to make predictions
3. **No New Data Required**: For recommendations, the model uses existing student/engagement vectors
4. **New Students**: New students get embeddings based on their features, compared against existing engagement vectors

**How it Works**:
```python
# Model generates 64-dimensional embeddings during training
student_embedding = model.get_student_embedding(student_id)  # From training data
engagement_embeddings = model.get_all_engagement_embeddings()  # From training data

# Recommendations use vector similarity
recommendations = find_similar_engagements(student_embedding, engagement_embeddings)
```

### **Q2: Goal Setting - How does it know which stages to target?**

**Answer**: The system uses **Funnel Stage Management** with goal targeting:

1. **Database-Driven**: Funnel stages stored in `funnel_stages` table
2. **Goal Configuration**: Each stage has `is_tracking_goal` and `tracking_goal_type` fields
3. **Smart Filtering**: Only generates recommendations for students **before** the target stage

**Example**:
```sql
-- Target: Application (stage_order = 3)
-- Eligible students: Those in Awareness (0), Interest (1), Consideration (2)
-- Excluded: Students already in Application (3) or Enrollment (4)
```

**Frontend Integration**:
- Dropdown shows all stages with goal indicators
- User selects target (e.g., "Application (Goal)")
- System only processes eligible students

### **Q3: Periodic Updates - How do they work?**

**Answer**: Implemented comprehensive periodic update system:

#### **Backend Routes**:
```bash
# Manual periodic update (for schedulers)
POST /initial-setup/periodic-update
{
  "update_type": "daily|weekly",
  "days_back": 1,
  "force_retrain": false
}
```

#### **Existing Scripts**:
1. **`scripts/ingest_students.py`**:
   - Updates student profiles
   - Calculates new risk/likelihood scores
   - Supports incremental updates
   
2. **`scripts/ingest_engagements.py`**:
   - Processes new engagement data
   - Updates student states
   - Triggers model retraining if needed

3. **`scripts/schedule_updates.py`**:
   - Background scheduler using APScheduler
   - Daily updates (1 AM)
   - Weekly updates (2 AM Sunday)

#### **Integration Points**:
```python
# External scheduler can call:
curl -X POST "/initial-setup/periodic-update" \
  -d '{"update_type": "daily", "days_back": 1}'

# Or use existing scripts directly:
python scripts/ingest_engagements.py --days 1
python scripts/ingest_students.py --days 1 --force-retrain
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### **New Backend Endpoints**:
```python
POST /initial-setup/generate-recommendations  # Generate bulk recommendations
GET  /initial-setup/recommendation-status     # Track generation progress
GET  /initial-setup/funnel-stages            # Get available stages
POST /initial-setup/periodic-update          # Scheduler integration
```

### **Frontend Enhancements**:
- Dual progress tracking (Training + Recommendations)
- Goal selection with stage information
- Confidence and batch size controls
- Real-time status updates for both processes

### **Database Integration**:
- Uses existing `funnel_stages` table
- Stores recommendations in `stored_recommendations`
- Tracks generation metadata and expiry dates

## üöÄ Next Steps & Usage

### **1. Model Training**:
1. Select environment mode (Testing/Production)
2. Click "Train Model"
3. Monitor progress in real-time

### **2. Generate Recommendations**:
1. Wait for model training to complete
2. Select target goal stage (default: Application)
3. Configure confidence threshold and batch settings
4. Click "Generate Recommendations"
5. Monitor progress in separate panel

### **3. Periodic Updates** (For Production):
Set up external scheduler (cron, etc.) to call:
```bash
# Daily at 1 AM
curl -X POST "your-api/initial-setup/periodic-update" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"update_type": "daily", "days_back": 1}'

# Weekly at 2 AM Sunday with retraining
curl -X POST "your-api/initial-setup/periodic-update" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"update_type": "weekly", "days_back": 7, "force_retrain": true}'
```
